###########################1) Median filtering pitch contour ###########################
#Motivation
#1) Remove spurious jumps in pitch due to octave errors or other errors
#2) Supress the extent of ornaments like Kan swar which arise challenges to segmentation process or in identification of stable note regions
#3) In general to smooth out pitch content supressing fine movements which might not be relevant for melodic similarity.
